## What is This Project?

CryptoChain is a **complete cryptocurrency blockchain implementation** built from scratch in JavaScript. It's like creating your own Bitcoin, but simplified for learning purposes. 

### What it includes:
- ✅ **Blockchain**: A chain of blocks containing transaction data
- ✅ **Cryptocurrency Wallet**: Digital wallets with public/private keys
- ✅ **Mining**: Proof-of-work algorithm to secure the network
- ✅ **Transactions**: Send and receive cryptocurrency
- ✅ **Peer-to-Peer Network**: Multiple nodes can connect and sync
- ✅ **REST API**: Web interface to interact with the blockchain

## Why These Technologies?

### Node.js & JavaScript
- **Why?** JavaScript is beginner-friendly and runs everywhere
- **What it does:** Server-side runtime for our blockchain network
- **Alternative:** Could use Python, Go, or Rust, but JS has a gentler learning curve

### Express.js
- **Why?** Simple web framework for creating APIs
- **What it does:** Handles HTTP requests (GET, POST) for our blockchain API
- **Alternative:** Could use Koa.js or Fastify, but Express is most popular

### Redis (Optional)
- **Why?** Fast pub/sub system for real-time communication between nodes
- **What it does:** Broadcasts new blocks and transactions to all connected nodes
- **Alternative:** WebSockets, but Redis is easier for beginners

### Jest
- **Why?** Popular testing framework with great documentation

## Core Concepts Explained

### 1. What is a Blockchain?
Think of a blockchain as a **digital ledger** (like a bank's transaction book) that:
- Is **immutable** (can't be changed once written)
- Is **distributed** (copied across many computers)
- Is **transparent** (everyone can see all transactions)
- Is **secure** (uses cryptography to prevent fraud)

### 2. What is a Block?
A block is like a **page in the ledger** containing:
- **Data**: Transaction information
- **Hash**: Unique fingerprint of the block
- **Previous Hash**: Links to the previous block (creates the "chain")
- **Timestamp**: When the block was created
- **Nonce**: Number used in mining (proof-of-work)

### 3. What is Mining?
Mining is like **solving a puzzle** to add a new block:
- Miners compete to find a special number (nonce)
- The first to solve it gets to add the block
- They receive a reward for their work
- This process secures the network

### 4. What is a Digital Wallet?
A wallet is like a **digital bank account** with:
- **Public Key**: Your account number (shareable)
- **Private Key**: Your password (secret)
- **Balance**: How much cryptocurrency you have
- **Transactions**: History of sends/receives

## Code Breakdown

### 1. Configuration (`config.js`)
```javascript
const INITIAL_DIFFICULTY = 3;        // How hard mining starts
const MINE_RATE = 1000;              // Target: 1 block per second
const STARTING_BALANCE = 1000;       // Everyone starts with 1000 coins
const MINING_REWARD = 50;            // Reward for mining a block
```

**Why these values?**
- `INITIAL_DIFFICULTY = 3`: Easy enough for testing, hard enough to show proof-of-work
- `MINE_RATE = 1000ms`: Fast enough for demos, slow enough to see the process
- `STARTING_BALANCE = 1000`: Gives everyone coins to start transacting
- `MINING_REWARD = 50`: Incentivizes miners (like Bitcoin's block reward)

### 2. Block Structure (`blockchain/block.js`)
```javascript
class Block {
    constructor({ timestamp, lastHash, hash, data, nonce, difficulty }) {
        this.timestamp = timestamp;    // When block was created
        this.lastHash = lastHash;      // Links to previous block
        this.hash = hash;              // Unique block identifier
        this.data = data;              // Transaction data
        this.nonce = nonce;            // Proof-of-work number
        this.difficulty = difficulty;   // Mining difficulty
    }
}
```

**Why this structure?**
- `timestamp`: Proves when block was created (prevents backdating)
- `lastHash`: Creates the "chain" - each block references the previous
- `hash`: Unique identifier - if data changes, hash changes
- `data`: The actual information we want to store
- `nonce`: The "magic number" miners find through trial and error
- `difficulty`: Self-adjusting to maintain consistent block time

### 3. Mining Algorithm (`block.js - mineBlock`)
```javascript
static mineBlock({ lastBlock, data }) {
    let hash, timestamp;
    const { difficulty } = lastBlock;
    let nonce = 0;
    
    do {
        nonce++;
        timestamp = Date.now();
        hash = cryptoHash(timestamp, lastBlock.hash, data, nonce, difficulty);
    } while (hash.substring(0, difficulty) !== '0'.repeat(difficulty));
    
    return new Block({
        timestamp,
        lastHash: lastBlock.hash,
        data,
        nonce,
        difficulty,
        hash
    });
}
```

**What's happening here?**
1. **Try different nonces**: Start with 0, increment until we find the right one
2. **Hash everything**: Combine timestamp, previous hash, data, nonce, and difficulty
3. **Check if valid**: Hash must start with required number of zeros
4. **Repeat until success**: This is the "work" in proof-of-work

**Why this approach?**
- **Security**: Changing any past data would require re-mining all subsequent blocks
- **Fairness**: Everyone has equal chance to find the nonce
- **Adjustable**: Difficulty can increase/decrease to maintain block time

### 4. Digital Signatures (`wallet/index.js`)
```javascript
class Wallet {
    constructor() {
        this.balance = STARTING_BALANCE;
        this.keyPair = ec.genKeyPair();                    // Generate keys
        this.publicKey = this.keyPair.getPublic().encode('hex');
    }
    
    sign(data) {
        return this.keyPair.sign(cryptoHash(data));        // Sign with private key
    }
}
```

**Why elliptic curve cryptography?**
- **Security**: Mathematically impossible to derive private key from public key
- **Efficiency**: Smaller keys, faster operations than RSA
- **Proven**: Used by Bitcoin, Ethereum, and most cryptocurrencies

### 5. Transaction Structure (`wallet/transaction.js`)
```javascript
class Transaction {
    constructor({ senderWallet, recipient, amount }) {
        this.id = uuid();                    // Unique transaction ID
        this.outputMap = {                   // Who gets how much
            [recipient]: amount,
            [senderWallet.publicKey]: senderWallet.balance - amount
        };
        this.input = {                       // Proof of authorization
            timestamp: Date.now(),
            amount: senderWallet.balance,
            address: senderWallet.publicKey,
            signature: senderWallet.sign(this.outputMap)
        };
    }
}
```

**Why this structure?**
- **outputMap**: Shows exactly where money goes (recipient gets X, sender keeps Y)
- **input**: Proves the sender authorized this transaction
- **signature**: Prevents fraud - only the private key holder can create this

### 6. Blockchain Validation (`blockchain/index.js`)
```javascript
static isValidChain(chain) {
    if (JSON.stringify(chain[0]) !== JSON.stringify(Block.genesis())) {
        return false;  // Must start with genesis block
    }
    
    for (let i = 1; i < chain.length; i++) {
        const { timestamp, lastHash, hash, nonce, difficulty, data } = chain[i];
        const actualLastHash = chain[i - 1].hash;
        
        if (lastHash !== actualLastHash) return false;  // Blocks must link
        
        const validatedHash = cryptoHash(timestamp, lastHash, data, nonce, difficulty);
        if (hash !== validatedHash) return false;       // Hash must be valid
    }
    
    return true;
}
```

**Why these checks?**
- **Genesis verification**: Ensures everyone starts from the same point
- **Link verification**: Prevents inserting/removing blocks from the middle
- **Hash verification**: Ensures no data has been tampered with

### 7. Peer-to-Peer Communication (`app/pubsub.js`)
```javascript
class PubSub {
    constructor({ blockchain, transactionPool }) {
        this.blockchain = blockchain;
        this.transactionPool = transactionPool;
        this.publisher = redis.createClient();   // For sending messages
        this.subscriber = redis.createClient();  // For receiving messages
    }
    
    broadcastChain() {
        this.publisher.publish('BLOCKCHAIN', JSON.stringify(this.blockchain.chain));
    }
}
```

**Why Redis pub/sub?**
- **Real-time**: Instantly broadcasts new blocks to all nodes
- **Scalable**: Can handle many connected nodes
- **Reliable**: Messages are guaranteed to be delivered

### 8. API Endpoints (`index.js`)
```javascript
app.get('/api/blocks', (req, res) => {
    res.json(blockchain.chain);              // View blockchain
});

app.post('/api/mine', (req, res) => {
    const { data } = req.body;
    blockchain.addBlock({ data });           // Mine new block
    pubsub.broadcastChain();                 // Tell other nodes
    res.redirect('/api/blocks');             // Show updated chain
});

app.post('/api/transact', (req, res) => {
    const { amount, recipient } = req.body;
    const transaction = wallet.createTransaction({ recipient, amount });
    transactionPool.setTransaction(transaction);
    pubsub.broadcastTransaction(transaction);
    res.json({ type: 'success', transaction });
});
```

**Why REST API?**
- **Universal**: Any language/tool can interact with it
- **Stateless**: Each request is independent
- **Cacheable**: Responses can be cached for performance

## How Everything Works Together

### 1. Starting the Network
```
1. Node starts up
2. Creates genesis block
3. Initializes empty transaction pool
4. Starts listening for API requests
5. Connects to other nodes (if any)
```

### 2. Creating a Transaction
```
1. User sends POST to /api/transact
2. Wallet creates and signs transaction
3. Transaction added to pool
4. Transaction broadcast to other nodes
5. Response sent back to user
```

### 3. Mining Process
```
1. Miner calls /api/mine-transactions
2. Gather all pending transactions
3. Validate each transaction
4. Try different nonces until valid hash found
5. Create new block with transactions
6. Add block to blockchain
7. Broadcast to other nodes
8. Clear transaction pool
```

### 4. Node Synchronization
```
1. New node joins network
2. Requests blockchain from existing nodes
3. Validates received blockchain
4. Replaces local chain if valid and longer
5. Requests pending transactions
6. Now synchronized with network
```

## Testing Guide

### Running Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Run all tests
npm test -- --verbose      # Detailed output
npm test block             # Test only block functionality
```

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('Blockchain', () => {
    let blockchain;
    
    beforeEach(() => {
        blockchain = new Blockchain();  // Fresh blockchain for each test
    });
    
    it('starts with genesis block', () => {
        expect(blockchain.chain[0]).toEqual(Block.genesis());
    });
});
```

**Why this testing approach?**
- **Isolation**: Each test starts with a clean state
- **Comprehensive**: Tests cover all major functionality
- **Automated**: Runs automatically to catch bugs

### API Testing with Thunder Client
1. **GET /api/blocks**: View current blockchain
2. **POST /api/mine**: Mine a new block
3. **POST /api/transact**: Create transaction
4. **GET /api/mine-transactions**: Mine pending transactions
